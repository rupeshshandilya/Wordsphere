Before this, it was usual to develop big programs by using monolithic architecture that are difficult to scale and maintain. To solve these problems, microservices architecture breaks down an application into a set of small services which can be deployed independently. This method has allowed for flexibility in changing programs as they grow and ensuring that they can always be made bigger without downtime.

> Still, there are many challenges when working with microservices for developers including how do you get different services talking to one another? How do you maintain consistency between data stored across multiple systems? And what tools should I use for monitoring a distributed environment among others. Many developers find it hard because it adds more work load on them due too many moving parts in such systems and also takes time before getting used to a new way of doing things like this.

## What are microservices

Microservices are **small, harmonious subsystems** that operate as independent services within a larger, cohesive application. Each microservice is designed to perform a specific function or set of functions, such as handling user authentication, processing payments, or managing customer profiles. This modular approach allows for each service to be developed deployed maintained scaled independently from other services in the application. By using microservices organizations can achieve greater agility improved fault isolation and the ability to use different technology stacks for different services, which optimizes resources and accelerates innovation.

Netflix is a good example of how a microservices architecture can be effectively utilized in a real-world application. Originally built as a monolithic application, Netflix evolved into a microservices architecture to handle its massive scale and rapid growth.

Here are some examples of how Netflix uses microservices to operate its streaming service:

1.  Recommendation Service: This is the service which manages algorithms and processes that recommend movies and shows according to usersâ€™ viewing history and preferences. It is essential to improve user engagement and satisfaction.
2.  Billing Service: Responsible for dealing with all matters concerning customer subscriptions and payments. It accepts payments and supervises billing periods so that there would be smooth deals with millions of customers.
3.  Service of Device Compatibility: Makes sure that Netflix streams well on many devices - from smart TVs and game consoles down to smartphones or tablets. Since each one can do different things and need different settings for it, this will make the streaming experience change all the time.
4.  Netflix made its own CDN (Content Delivery Network) known as Open Connect to serve high-definition video streams internationally and quickly by situating data near users across the globe. This has worked well for me so far!.
5.  User Account Service: Handles user profiles, authentication and account settings to secure user data and make it available across various devices.

Now we're going to try out another header style.
